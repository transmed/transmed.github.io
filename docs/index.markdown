# TransMed 2021

## Description

<img src="pics/transmed_logo.jpg" alt="drawin" style="float: left" width="120"/> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Knowledge-based translational medicine is a rapidly growing discipline in biomedical research and aims to expedite the discovery of new diagnostic tools and treatments by using a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, "bench-to-bedside" approach. Large amounts of multi-omics, imaging (medical and molecular) and clinical data can now be captured for given patient populations. In addition to the challenges of data curation and harmonisation, new computational methods are required to identify molecular signatures that suggest disease subtype. These signatures may be predictive of outcome or progression, and impact on disease management by suggesting personalised therapeutic strategies for patients. Such approaches will further the development of a new taxonomy of disease.</p>

In the TransMed COSI meeting, we will explore the current status of computational biology approaches within the field of translational medicine.

**[Prof. Kenneth D. Mandl](https://scholar.harvard.edu/mandl)**, Harvard Medical School

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right:10px;">	
Biography: Dr. Kenneth Mandl directs the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children's Hospital and is the Donald A.B. Lindberg Professor of Pediatrics and Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. He is trained as a pediatrician and pediatric emergency physician.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">	
His work at the intersection of population and individual health has had a unique, sustained influence on the developing field of biomedical informatics. Mandl’s Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers was for pioneering real time biosurveillance, tracking infections and detecting outbreaks with diverse data. He has long advocated for patient participation in producing and accessing data and was a pioneer of the first personal health systems, using crowdsourced knowledge from online patient networks, and advancing participatory medicine and engagement in clinical trials.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">	
Cognizant of the limitations of extant electronic health record systems, Mandl developed a widely-adopted, highly influential approach (SMART)--substitutable apps that run universally on health IT systems. SMART lets innovators reach market scale and patients and doctors access an “app store for health.” Through the 21st Century Cures Act, SMART is now regulated as the standard interface by which patients, providers, and apps access data from electronic health records. He applies open source inventions to lead EHR research networks. He is a leader of the Genomics Research and Innovation Network across three leading children’s hospitals. He directs the Boston Children’s Hospital PrecisionLink Biobank for Health Discovery.</p>
